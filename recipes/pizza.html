    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella <br> or other cheese, 
        and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature <br> and served hot.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend <br> relates that it was 
        named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its <br> topping colours—green, white, and red—were 
        those of the Italian flag.
